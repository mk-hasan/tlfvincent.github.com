After spending some time posting the results my analysis on the now [defunct wordpress blog](https://statofmind.wordpress.com), I have come to the realization that the features offered by wordpress.org are insufiicient. While it provides a great platform for blogging, the inability to embed anything related to JavaScript has sometimes held me back. Therefore, I seeked to find a lightweight blogging platform that would only require some (but not too much) maintenance. After some investigation, it became apparent that GitHub Pages was the best solution, and it would come with the bonus of version control! 

Setting up a [GitHub page was easy](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained), but constructing a blog scaffold proved to be a bit more difficult. Eventually, a came across the following [link](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html), which claims to

> Get a complete blog scaffold published and hosted on GitHub Pages in 3 minutes!

To my surprise this turned out to be true! In addition, it gave the option to choose between a set of various themes (albeit a limited set). To do so, follow this [link](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-theming.html), which provides a [theme launch explorer](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/) that displays your blog under various themes
